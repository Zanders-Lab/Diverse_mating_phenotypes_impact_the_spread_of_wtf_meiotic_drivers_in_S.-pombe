# Diverse mating phenotypes impact the spread of wtf meiotic drivers in _S. pombe_

The current project holds the functions used to analyze cytometry data and to simulate the spread of _wtf_ meiotic drivers given initial experimental parameters. The flow cytomtery raw data is located in the Original Data Repository https://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1625, internal repository and open access from the Stowers Insititute for Medical Research.

The model and quantitations are explained in the Methods section of the manuscript. The scripts enclose all the parameters necessary to simulate and reproduce the figures presented in the article: eLife 2021;10:e70812
